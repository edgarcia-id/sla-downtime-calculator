### 🧐 Why this tool?
As an IT Consultant, I often see confusion between vendors and clients regarding what "99.9% Uptime" actually means in real-world time.

* **99.9%** allows for **8h 45m** of downtime per year.
* **99.99%** allows for only **52m 35s** of downtime per year.

This tool helps IT Managers, SysAdmins, and Procurement teams visualize these metrics instantly.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* HTML5 & Bootstrap 5
* Vanilla JavaScript (No heavy frameworks)
* Clean & Lightweight
